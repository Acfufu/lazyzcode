## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-06

First release: the AI coding-workflow discipline layer for ZCode —
plan, execute, take evidence, never stop half-done.

### Added

- **Goal loop CLI (`lzy loop` / `lzy step`)**: register a goal, adopt a
  decision-complete plan (N/F checklist; TBD items rejected), execute step by
  step, bind F-item evidence to `git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}`, and pass the
  `finish` gate (all steps done + fresh evidence) before declaring victory.
- **Discipline plugin**: `lazyzcode:zw` skill (English orchestration protocol),
  UserPromptSubmit trigger-word hook (`zw`/`ulw`/`ultrawork`, word-boundary
  match), SessionStart loop-state re-injection, and a Stop continuation hook
  (max 2 per session — the engine's shared 3-continue pool reserves 1 for
  background notifications; per-sessionId counters; fail-open on any error).
- **Comment-checker advisory hook**: PostToolUse (Edit/Write) detection of
  TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK markers and debug residue (`console.log`, `console.debug`,
  `debugger`) in new content, surfaced via `additionalContext` (inject-only,
  never blocks; active only in workspaces with a goal loop; capped at 5 hits,
  300 chars).
- **Read-only discipline agents**: `lazyzcode:explorer` (pre-plan recon with
  codegraph index guidance for large repos), `lazyzcode:plan-reviewer`
  (mandatory HEAVY plan gate — REVISE verdicts reject adoption, `--force`
  cannot bypass), `lazyzcode:qa-executor` (real-surface evidence capture;
  ego-browser/curl for web surfaces).
- **Installer**: `lzy install` / `sync` / `status` / `doctor` / `uninstall`.
  Enabling flows only through the engine's official `plugins enable`;
  `lzy` never writes the user's `config.json` (ADR-0001). `lzy doctor` adds
  hook syntax self-check (vm-parse only), node version floor, `lzy` PATH-shim
  report, `.lazyzcode/` state hygiene and platform notice — fully local,
  zero telemetry.
- **codegraph wiring**: `lzy status` reports codegraph availability
  (MCP config + CLI; absence is `skip`, never `fail`).

### Notes

- macOS-only engine layout; other platforms report "not found" instead of
  guessing.
- Published artifacts ship `cli/`, `core/`, `plugin/` plus README/LICENSE/
  CHANGELOG; session-state and tool directories are excluded.
